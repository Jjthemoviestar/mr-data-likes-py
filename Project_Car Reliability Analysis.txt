I want to take the top reliable cars, the retail price, 
and the average cost of repair based on the number of repairs.

For example, the number of repairs for a PORCHE might be small compaired to a 
FORD, but what is the cost of that repair, and the cost of repair in relation 
to the cost of the vehicle.
